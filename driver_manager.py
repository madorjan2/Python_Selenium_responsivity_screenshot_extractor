Responsivity Image Extraction Tool - Driver Manager

A collection of functions that create a Selenium Webdriver object and navigate them to the desired webpage.
Only functions that start with visit_ will be called by main.py

Every visit_ function must have a webdriver parameter set to None by default, so it can create the driver if needed
(if it was called without input parameters) as well as handle a driver given to it as a parameter.

Every visit_ function must return the driver as well as a string to be used in the directory path.

By default, a visit_ function should look something like this:
def visit_site(driver=None):
    if driver is None:
        driver = create_driver()
    driver.maximize_window()
    driver.get(site_url)
    additional navigation steps if necessary
    return driver, "string_to_be_included_in_path"


Every visit_ functions should have a post_ method that cleans up whatever needs cleaning and quits the Webdriver.
